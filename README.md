# Natural Language-Processing
Vaccine sentiment classifier and QA deep learning model for the Artificial Intelligence II course at UoA.

Modules: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and nltk for lemmatization

• The first sentiment classifier was a simple softmax regression model and so I gained knowledge in the
fundamentals of machine learning algorithms. Also, Ι studied pre-processing techniques, vectorizers, and metrics.

• Using the same dataset I implemented a multi-layer feed-forward neural network and experimented with deep
learning techniques, training, validation, and a variety of optimizers and loss functions.

• For the third model I used a bidirectional stacked RNN with LSTM/GRU cells and optimized the number of
stacked RNNs, the number of hidden layers, type of cells, skip connections, gradient clipping, and dropout
probability to be as efficient as possible.

• Finally, I fine-tuned the pretrained BERT-base model for the given dataset

Question-Answering: Developed a model for question answering on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset by fine-tuning BERT for
question-answering, reproduced the results for SQuAD 2.0 and TriviaQA from the paper “What do Models Learn from
Question Answering Datasets?”.
